简单技巧： 

1.`if (N & N-1) == 0` 则N一定是2的 n次幂<br>
thread_test.cpp:  
  多进程通信的方式之一，如果子进程退出，父进程得知子进程退出。  
  如果子进程没有退出，为了防止父进程中 wait() 一直阻塞，定时循环fork()出一个undefined子进程，立刻exit()  
  通过上面的方式，可以激活wait()阻塞  
  
2. "optimizing_cpp.pdf" note:  
  Compiler will not do this, manual write codes like    
  <code>
  int res = a+b+c+d;<br>    
  int res = (a+b)+(c+d);<br>  
  </code>
  for out order with processors flow      
  declare variable in the function because of stack ( data is mirrored in Level 1 cache)    
  variable will not be free until function, except that which stored in register. To avoid this, using {} .    
  global stored in static scope. static scope used for static variable, virtual function tables, array initializer list, switch statement jump tables.  
  
  Advantage : static value should be initialized before program run.  
  Disadvantage: stored whole program running time.  
  
  global should be avoided, except that multi threads communicating.  
  integer values are supposed to no cache problem.  
  register 8 floating registers in 32 bits system, 16 for 64 bits system.  
  
  volatile can changed by other thread.  
  // Example 7.3. Explain volatile  
  '''c
  volatile int seconds; // incremented every second by another thread
  void DelayFiveSeconds() {
    seconds = 0;
    while (seconds < 5) {
      // do nothing while seconds count to 5
    }  
  }  
  '''
  
"second" will not be changed if there is no volatile before it. here 'second' could be changed by other threads.  
But it will failed to set the 'second' when other thread who want to set the value as well.  
it doesn't mean that atomic.  

__thread or declare (__thread) is inefficient because there is only 1 point to point the thread evn list, using these value as stack.  

heap can easily fragmented.  

class object not be stored in register, but its data member can be stored in register.  
static class member will be located in static memory, it should be only one, common variable will be stored in each instance of class.  

`int res = (a*b) / c , a*b will be overflow, this is not be check automatically.`  
unsigned vs signed integer:  
unsigned is faster if divide a integer with a constant , it also suit for the module "%"  
signed for convert to double.  
'''c
unsigned n = 15;	15/5	or 15%5 is faster.
double c = a*2.5; a is signed is faster
'''
TODO:  
  3.template class is more efficient than a polymorphous class?    
  4. pros and cons of using class ......      
  5. drawback of dynamic memory will be discussed later ...
